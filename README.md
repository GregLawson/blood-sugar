# blood-sugar
Development of a mathematical model of blood sugar, diet, exersize.

Inspired by Jenny Ruhl's books Blood Sugar 101, Diet 101, and the scientific research she has uncovered.

The target audience is people with abnormal blood sugar, including a majority of adults ([UCLA study](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/majority-of-california-adults-have-prediabetes-or-diabetes)).

### Minimal model
G.(t)=−a1G(t)−a2I(t)+J(t)

I.(t)=a3G(t)−a4I(t)
